This project was developed as part of an internship task to demonstrate the use of Python for fetching and visualizing real-time data from a public API. The OpenWeatherMap API was used to collect current weather 
information for a specific city, which was then processed and visualized using Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries. The script is capable of displaying key weather metrics such as temperature, humidity, pressure, and 
general weather conditions in a visually appealing format. Development was done using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as the primary code editor, taking advantage of its features for Python development and debugging. 
To complete the task efficiently, I referred to multiple learning resources including YouTube tutorials, W3Schools, and the official documentation for the libraries and APIs used. The final deliverables include a 
well-documented Python script and a set of visualizations that serve as a simple but effective weather dashboard. This project reflects my understanding of API integration, JSON handling, and data visualization â€” 
essential skills in real-world Python programming.
